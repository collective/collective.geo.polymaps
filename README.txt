Introduction
============

Polymaps provides speedy display of multi-zoom datasets over maps,
and supports a variety of visual presentations for tiled vector data,
in addition to the usual cartography from OpenStreetMap, CloudMade,
Bing, and other providers of image-based web maps.

collective.geo.polymaps uses collective.geo to store the mapcontent.
It is a drop in replacement for collective.geo.mapwidget.



Known issues, limitations and caveats

- It can only display GeoJson, no KML or other formats

- It does not play well with older browsers (especially IE)

- No support for google maplayers
